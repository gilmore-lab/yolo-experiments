# YOLO-demo

This repo contains code to explore the use of the [YOLO](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/) computer vision object detection tool for problems in behavioral science.

- Test document to run demos. Knit `YOLO-demo.Rmd` or `rmarkdown::render('YOLO-demo.Rmd`) **after** you have downloaded the model and weights.
